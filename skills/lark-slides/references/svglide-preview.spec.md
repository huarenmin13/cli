# SVGlide Preview Spec

Read this file only after `svglide-svg` route admission. Preview validates local visual quality before API calls; it does not replace source preflight or live readback.

## Preview Contract

`preview.html` should:

- Read `04-svg/prepared/*.svg` in `svg_files` order.
- Write `05-preview/preview.html`.
- Write `05-preview/preview-manifest.json`.
- Embed every prepared SVG page in the preview HTML.
- Preserve the 16:9 `960 x 540` page box.
- Keep page labels and review metadata outside the SVG canvas.
- Show image assets as they will appear in local preview, with preview-only sources recorded in the plan.
- Avoid visible safe-area rectangles, debug guides, bbox guides, or layout helper marks.

## Lint Contract

Run:

```bash
python3 skills/lark-slides/scripts/svg_preview_lint.py \
  .lark-slides/plan/<deck-id>/05-preview/preview.html --pretty
```

Required output shape:

```json
{
  "rendering_mode": "static_dom_approximation",
  "screenshot_paths": [],
  "summary": {"error_count": 0, "warning_count": 0},
  "page_issues": [],
  "action": "create_live"
}
```

Any preview lint error sets `action` to `repair_and_rerun` and blocks live create.

Save the lint output as `06-check/preview-lint.json`. It is one input to `quality_gate`; `svglide_semantic_review.py` is an optional legacy diagnostic and must not block create.

## Review Contract

After lint passes, record an aesthetic review with:

- `preview_path`: `05-preview/preview.html`
- `plan_path`: `02-plan/slide_plan.json`
- checked page count
- score and threshold
- issue ids and affected pages
- action: `create_live` or `repair_and_rerun`

The review must inspect every page for blank output, clipping, text overlap, image visibility, weak SVG-native structure, repeated layouts, and closing slide presence. If a repeated issue appears across pages, repair the generator or source pattern and rerun preflight and preview lint.

## Boundary

Preview can catch local layout problems. It does not validate Chinese delivery quality, page type structure, content depth, source refs, or generator text provenance. Those concerns are handled by planning/source review, aesthetic review, runtime review, and optional human or semantic diagnostics. Readback is still required because the server conversion can change text boxes, image tokens, path bounds, and supported SVG effects.
