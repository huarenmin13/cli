# SVGlide Validation Checklist

Read this file only after `svglide-svg` route admission. Shared XML validation still lives in `validation-checklist.md`.

Compatibility note: new runner-first check paths are defined in `svglide-checks.checklist.md`. Keep this file for gate semantics; use the staged `02-plan`, `04-svg/prepared`, `05-preview`, `06-check`, `07-create`, and `08-readback` paths for new work.

## Required Flow

1. Validate the SVG plan against `svglide-plan.schema.json` and route admission.
2. Run `svglide_source.py` to produce a fresh source receipt and evidence pack. User runs default to online-first through the runner; CI/golden should use `--network-policy fixture` or `--offline`.
3. Run local source preflight with `svg_preflight.py --plan`.
4. Build or inspect a local preview when practical, then run `svg_preview_lint.py` before live create.
5. Record an aesthetic review following `svg-aesthetic-review.md`; this review cannot replace deterministic lint.
6. Run `svglide_chart_verify.py` and `svglide_runtime_review.py` before `quality_gate`.
7. Run `slides +create-svg --dry-run` when command behavior is under review.
8. Run `svglide_ppe_proof.py` before live create.
9. After live create, use `xml_presentations.get` readback and record page count, blank-page, asset, bounds, and text-fit checks.

Treat the gate as a single chain:

```text
route admission
-> loaded_rule_set + art_direction + business_claims
-> source receipt
-> asset manifest / image jobs
-> svg_preflight --plan
-> svg_preview_lint.py
-> aesthetic review record
-> chart_verify
-> runtime_review
-> quality_gate
-> dry-run
-> ppe_proof
-> live create
-> readback checks
```

Any P0/error-level result before live create blocks the API call.

## Online-First Flags

Runner flags:

- `--offline`: disables online research and image acquisition.
- `--no-online-research`: keeps source local-only.
- `--no-image-search`: disables web image search/download.
- `--no-ai-image`: disables AI image job planning.
- `--refresh-online`: refreshes source/assets instead of reusing existing artifacts.
- `--network-policy auto|online|offline|fixture`: choose online-first, forced online, local-only, or deterministic fixture behavior.
- `--asset-provider` and `--image-backend`: record acquisition/provider intent in asset receipts.

## Local Preflight

```bash
python3 skills/lark-slides/scripts/svg_preflight.py \
  --plan .lark-slides/plan/<deck-id>/02-plan/slide_plan.json \
  --input .lark-slides/plan/<deck-id>/04-svg/prepared/page-001.svg
```

Pass criteria:

- `summary.error_count == 0`; any error blocks live API calls.
- `loaded_rule_set` records the SVG private design and validation files loaded for the run.
- `art_direction` records cover, section-divider/tempo, closing, deck motif, and at least 3 family-backed visual moments.
- `quality_gates` includes `no_text_overflow`, `no_debug_guides`, and `no_xml_like_pages` set to true.
- Visible numeric or business claims have `business_claims` source records; derived or assumed claims include derivation/assumption notes.
- `template_family_selection` exists, is enabled, and references `beautiful-html-template-families`.
- Every page declares `template_variant`, `semantic_blocks`, `component_selection`, and `asset_strategy`.
- Every page declares the SVG-only planning fields listed in `svglide-planning-layer.md`.
- Required image slots are filled for preview, and live submit has upload/file token evidence when required.
- Unowned decorative primitives are absent; decorative motifs must be family-owned and within budget.
- Visible slide text does not leak source tokens, prompts, tool names, or local file paths.

Common remediation:

| code | Meaning | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| `plan_missing_template_family_selection` | No deck-level family selection | Select a family from `beautiful-html-template-families.json` |
| `plan_missing_template_variant` | Page lacks a family variant | Choose a variant supported by the selected family |
| `plan_missing_component_selection` | Page semantic blocks are not bound to components | Bind blocks to `component-registry.json` components |
| `asset_slot_unfilled` | Required image slot is empty | Fetch/upload a matching asset or downgrade the whole group to structured fallback |
| `unowned_decorative_primitive` | Decorative line/path is not owned by a family motif | Remove it or attach a valid family motif owner |
| `plan_missing_loaded_rule_set` | SVG private refs were not recorded | Add the manifest-required SVG rule file list |
| `plan_missing_art_direction` | No deck-level design strategy | Add cover/section/closing treatments, motif, and SVG-native moments |
| `plan_missing_business_claims` | Visible numeric/business claims lack source records | Mark each claim as prompt-provided, derived, assumption, etc. |

## Preview Lint

Run preview lint on local HTML/SVG preview before live create:

```bash
python3 skills/lark-slides/scripts/svg_preview_lint.py \
  .lark-slides/plan/<deck-id>/05-preview/preview.html --pretty
```

Pass criteria:

- `summary.error_count == 0`; errors block live create.
- `action == "create_live"`.
- `page_issues` has no `preview_safe_area_debug_rect_visible`, `preview_debug_guide_visible`, `preview_text_overflow_risk`, or `preview_big_number_box_tight`.
- `rendering_mode` may be `static_dom_approximation` until a headless renderer is available; keep `screenshot_paths` in the output shape so rendered checks can be added without changing downstream gates.

Preview lint owns rendered/local-preview risks. Do not duplicate recipe-family or source-primitives rules here; those stay in `svg_preflight.py`.

## Aesthetic Preview Review

After deterministic preflight passes, inspect rendered preview and follow `svg-aesthetic-review.md`.

Pass criteria:

- Every page is checked, not only the cover.
- No obvious overlap or clipping among titles, body text, badges, decorations, image frames, chart labels, and footers.
- Root canvas and main content follow the 960 x 540 canvas and safe area.
- Each page has a clear visual focal point that matches the declared signature.
- Pages do not look like ordinary card/bullet XML pages with SVG wrapped around them.
- Repeated layout problems are fixed in the generator or source, then preflight is rerun.
- Review records include preview path, score, threshold, issue ids, and action.
- If independent review score is below the configured threshold, record `action: repair_and_rerun`; do not treat self-scoring as a gate.

## Optional Semantic Diagnostic

`svglide_semantic_review.py` is no longer part of the default create gate. Use it only as a manual diagnostic when investigating text provenance or source alignment:

```bash
python3 skills/lark-slides/scripts/svglide_semantic_review.py \
  .lark-slides/plan/<deck-id> --profile preview_only --pretty
```

Advisory criteria:

- `summary.error_count == 0`.
- `language == zh-CN`, `audience` is non-empty, and `deck_structure` covers the required page types.
- Every slide has `page_type`, `section`, `role`, Chinese `title`, Chinese `key_message`, and sufficient `body_points`.
- Content slides have source refs that resolve to `source/evidence.json`.
- Numeric claims have source refs; blocked online research is not acceptable for production/live profiles.
- `06-check/text-inventory.json` contains no unmatched visible SVG text.

Semantic review owns content-language and plan/source provenance. Do not treat a clean preview or aesthetic score as a substitute for this gate.

## Chart And Runtime Review

- `06-check/chart-verify.json` must be fresh. Pages declaring `chart_contract.verify=required` or exact chart precision must have chart data and chart-like SVG marks.
- `06-check/runtime-review.json` must be fresh. Each page must declare `renderer_id` and `layout_family`; 4+ page decks cannot use a single renderer or layout family throughout; image-led cover/closing assets must match cover/closing renderer families.
- `06-check/visual-distinctness.json` must be fresh. Topic-only decks must have a theme-specific `visual_identity`; different themes cannot reuse the same style preset, palette, cover treatment, and renderer/layout sequence.
- `06-check/aesthetic-review.json` must verify asset placement metadata from `03-assets/asset-manifest.json`; cover/background/closing images require safe editable text zones.

## Readback Checks

Live create is not complete until readback confirms:

- Actual page count matches the plan and user request.
- No page is blank or missing its key message.
- Images are visible or explicitly documented as preview-only risk.
- Converted XML keeps content inside canvas and safe area.
- Text boxes, labels, and footer/source notes remain readable.
- Closing slide is present when required.
- Readback records must be tied to the same plan, quality gate, dry-run, PPE proof, and live-create digests. HTML preview is not a substitute for readback because server conversion can change text boxes, image tokens, and bounds.
